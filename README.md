## Development

After checking out the repo,

- run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
- Then, run `bundle exec rake build` to build native extension.
- Then, run `bundle exec rake spec` to run the tests.
- You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
